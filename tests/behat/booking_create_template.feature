  Scenario: Booking option template: create one and use it to create new option
    Given I am on the "My booking" Activity page logged in as teacher1
    ## Prepare option
    And I follow "New booking option"
    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Booking option name | New option - by template |
    And I set the field "Add to course calendar" to "Add to calendar (visible only to course participants)"
    And I press "Add date"
    And I wait "1" seconds
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | coursestarttime_1[day]    | ##tomorrow##%d##     |
      | coursestarttime_1[month]  | ##tomorrow##%B##     |
      | coursestarttime_1[year]   | ##tomorrow##%Y##     |
      | courseendtime_1[day]      | ##tomorrow##%d##     |
      | courseendtime_1[month]    | ##tomorrow##%B##     |
      | courseendtime_1[year]     | ## + 1 year ## %Y ## |
    And I press "applydate_1"
    ## Set as template
    And I follow "Add as template"
    And I set the field "addastemplate" to "Use as global template"
    And I press "Save and go back"
    And I wait until the page is ready
    ## Required to avoid erros like "invalid session id" on the step next to "New option"
    And I wait "1" seconds
    ## Use template
    And I follow "New booking option"
    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I set the field "optiontemplateid" to "New option - by template"
    And I wait "1" seconds
    And I press "Save and go back"
    Then I should see "New option - by template"
