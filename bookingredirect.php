 * Booking redirect
 *
 * This is a very simple script which allows us to pass a base64 encoded URL
 * as param and redirect to the decoded URL.
 * This was needed because it wasn't possible to stop the Moodle calendar exporter
 * from escaping "&" to "&amp;" HTML entitities which made it impossible
 * to open links within outlook events.
